<strong>Key examples include:</strong>

* [Mouse XY Classifier](https://editor.p5js.org/jen_GSA/sketches/0kaQK8DJI)

### Physical Teachable Machines
These examples work with a range of methods:
* Training directly in ML5 with the neural net function
* Training in the Arduino IDE with the Simple_KNN library.
* Training with Tensorflow Lite using the Arduino_TensorflowLite library and Google Colabs

Each method will be outlined below. 

#### Training directly in ML5 with the neural net function
You can send serial messages from any Arduino input directly into P5JS and use the ML5 neural net function to train these. You will need the corresponding Arduino code uplaoded on to your board for each example to work. The corresponding Arduino code can be found in the [Physical teachable Machines folder]() on this repo or each .ino file is directly referenced at the top of P5JS code.

<strong>Key examples include:</strong>
* [Classify 3 serial inputs](https://editor.p5js.org/jen_GSA/sketches/dns24nOSN)
* [Classify 3 web USB inputs](https://editor.p5js.org/jen_GSA/sketches/DTCsb7qus)
* [Classify an array of LDR inputs](https://editor.p5js.org/jen_GSA/sketches/-meXI41cH)
* [Classify Capacitive Touch](https://editor.p5js.org/jen_GSA/sketches/9MQHS3KC)
* [Classify Gestures with IMU sensors and visula confidence output](https://editor.p5js.org/jen_GSA/sketches/P776cKng)

If you are using the <strong>serial</strong> examples you will also need to run the [P5 Serial App](https://github.com/p5-serial/p5.serialport) alongside them.

If you are using the <strong>webUSB</strong> examples you do not require any 3rd party apps. However, you will need to make sure your Arduino board is compatible. A list of compatible boards can be found [here](https://github.com/webusb/arduino)

#### Arduino IDE and the Simple_KNN library.
In the past year is has become more accessible to run Machine Learning algrithms directly on the micro-controller (Arduino) using [TensorflowLite](https://github.com/arduino/ArduinoTensorFlowLiteTutorials) and [KNN libraries](https://github.com/arduino-libraries/Arduino_KNN). 

This repo contains examples to get you started using KNN algorithms all self-contained in Arduino. You can also find examples taking the basic structure one or two steps further to trigger different physical outputs. 

<strong>Key examples include:</strong>
* [Simple KNN template](https://github.com/j3nsykes/creativeML2020/tree/master/PhysicalTeachableMachines/Arduino_KNN/SimpleKNN)
* [Classify Colour](https://github.com/j3nsykes/creativeML2020/tree/master/PhysicalTeachableMachines/Arduino_KNN/ColorClassifier)
* [Classify Orientation](https://github.com/j3nsykes/creativeML2020/tree/master/PhysicalTeachableMachines/Arduino_KNN/BoardOrientation)
* [Classify Color to physical output](https://github.com/j3nsykes/creativeML2020/tree/master/PhysicalTeachableMachines/Arduino_KNN/ColorClassifier_to_Output)
* [Classify Orientation to LED output](https://github.com/j3nsykes/creativeML2020/tree/master/PhysicalTeachableMachines/Arduino_KNN/BoardOrientation_to_LEDoutput)
* [Classify Color to neopixel output](https://github.com/j3nsykes/creativeML2020/tree/master/PhysicalTeachableMachines/Arduino_KNN/ColorClassifier_to_neoPixel)

These examples require the <strong>Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense</strong> board. A guide to starting with Arduino and libraries can be found [here](https://j3nsykes.github.io/ArduinoSetup/).

<!--As there are different positives and negatives to the varioous approaches with Physical Computing and ML an in-depth walk- through of the examples can be found [here]().-->


#### Training with Tensorflow Lite using the Arduino_TensorflowLite library and Google Colabs. 
You can train more detailed inputs using TensorFlow Lite and Google CoLabs. They provide detailed tutorials and pre-trained models to train on top of. These examples are a little more advanced and require some familiarity with Google Colab, file structures and working with multiple .ino files.

### RunwayML
These examples build upon the existing [RunwayML Processing library](https://github.com/runwayml/processing-library) and [P5JS examples](https://github.com/runwayml/p5js) taking these basic network structures further to explore experimental interactions with chat bot generating imagery, capacitive touch latent walks, speech feedback loops and motorised outputs to name a few. Have an explore!

* [GPT2- SpokenOutput](https://github.com/j3nsykes/creativeML2020/tree/master/PhysicalRunwayExperiements/Processing/GPT2-SpokenOutput/GPT2_speech)

<strong>Key P5JS examples include:</strong>
* [StyleGAN Latent Walk](https://editor.p5js.org/jen_GSA/sketches/WKRBKt88)
* [Speech Recognition to GPT2](https://editor.p5js.org/jen_GSA/sketches/gTuBw-ki)
